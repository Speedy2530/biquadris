Idea for representing differnet players in game engine:

each player has its own level and board, can be represented in vectors

e.g. vector playerLevels: Level p1, Level p2

when wanting to get next block of p1:

Block next = playerLevels[int p1 //0//]->getNextBlock()


BOARD should have a Absolute position for X and Y of the current block, representing the
bottom left.
